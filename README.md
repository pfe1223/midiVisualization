midiVisualization
=================

Final project for my Media Studio I class. The visualization created in Processing for MIDI input. An adhoc wifi netwrok was created between my Macbook Pro and iPad. The iPad app Thumbjam was used to create the MIDI input, and was routed to Garage Band. The visualization is a simple grid of 25 cells by 25 cells. When the program sensed an onNote, a random cell was selected and colored with a random color. When an offNote was detected another random cell was selected and filled with a random color.
